How to Use  

1. Set Up Audio Data:  
   Create instances of `AudioClipHolder` to organize your `AudioClips` and `MusicClips`. Add your audio files to these instances.

2. Configure Mixers:  
   Use the `MasterMixer` and its sub-mixers (`Music`, `Sfx`, etc.) to control audio levels and transitions.

3. Integrate Scripts:  
   - Use `AudioManager` for pooling of audioSource.  
   - Use `SoundManager` to trigger sounds and manage audio logic.  
   - Use `SoundPlayer` for playing specific sounds dynamically.

4. Customize Settings:  
   Adjust audio settings in the SoundSetting scene or integrate similar UI in your project.

5. Test and Iterate:  
   Use the sample audio files and mixers provided in the SampleAudios folder to test your setup.
